# 2012 Results

There were many participants and six official submissions to the DFRWS 2012 Forensics Challenge, which was to evaluate the state of the art in data encoding classification. Unlike prior challenges, which were more in the spirit of ``guests,'' this challenge was formulated as an explicit `best-of-breed' competition of tools.

This year DFRWS offered a prize for a winning submission that exhibited all the attributes of a field-ready tool with the necessary robustness and performance. While there was a clear winner among submissions, the challenge organizers did not feel any submission sufficiently met these goals, and the prize was not awarded.

## The Winner
The winning submission for the DFRWS2012 Forensics Challenge was created by Laurence Maddox, Lishu Liu, DJ Bauch & Nicole Beebe from University of Texas - San Antonio.

# 2013 Results
There were two official submissions to the DFRWS 2013 Forensics Challenge, which was a continuation of the 2012 challenge to evaluate the state of the art in data encoding classification. As in 2012, this challenge was formulated as an explicit `best-of-breed' competition of tools. The lack of quantity of submissions was met with much greater quality of submissions as compared to 2012's submissions.

This year DFRWS offered a prize for a winning submission that exhibited all the attributes of a field-ready tool with the necessary robustness and performance, and a clear winner emerged.
